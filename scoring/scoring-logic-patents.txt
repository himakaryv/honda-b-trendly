Scoring Framework for Patent-Based Trend Analysis
Credibility Scoring (Weight: 30%) X Frequency Scoring (Weight: 25%) X Recency Scoring (Weight: 25%) X  Relevance Scoring (Weight: 20%)


Credibility = (Patent Office Score × 0.4) + (Assignee Score × 0.3) + (Quality Indicators × 0.3)
Frequency = (Growth Rate × 0.4) + (Volume × 0.3) + (Competitive Intensity × 0.3)
Recency = (Timeline Score × 0.5) + (Acceleration × 0.3) + (Evolution Signals × 0.2)
Relevance = (Commercial Applicability × 0.5) + (Strategic Value × 0.25) + (Market Validation × 0.25)
1. Credibility Scoring (Weight: 30%)
Credibility = (Patent Office Score × 0.4) + (Assignee Score × 0.3) + (Quality Indicators × 0.3)
Patent Office Tier Assessment (0-10 scale):
* Tier 1 (9-10 points): Triadic patents (filed in USPTO, EPO, and JPO simultaneously)
* Tier 2 (7-8 points): USPTO or EPO patents with examination completed
* Tier 3 (5-6 points): Single major office (USPTO, EPO, JPO, CNIPA) with granted status
* Tier 4 (3-4 points): PCT applications or pending applications in major offices
* Tier 5 (1-2 points): Single country filings, provisional patents, or applications only
Assignee Authority Metrics:
* Industry Leaders (10 points): Fortune 500, recognized innovation leaders (IBM, Samsung, Google)
* Specialized Leaders (8 points): Domain leaders in specific technology (ASML for lithography)
* Mid-tier Innovators (6 points): Established companies with consistent patent portfolios
* Startups/Scale-ups (4 points): VC-backed companies with <500 employees
* Individual inventors (2 points): Non-affiliated inventors or micro-entities
Patent Quality Indicators:

* Licensed to multiple parties: +2 bonus
2. Frequency Scoring (Weight: 25%)
Frequency = (Growth Rate × 0.4) + (Volume × 0.3) + (Competitive Intensity × 0.3)
Patent Filing Velocity Metrics:
* Explosive growth (10 points): >200% year-over-year increase in patent families
* Rapid growth (8 points): 100-200% YoY increase
* Strong growth (6 points): 50-100% YoY increase
* Moderate growth (4 points): 20-50% YoY increase
* Emerging (2 points): <20% YoY increase
Absolute Volume Thresholds:
* 1000 patent families/year in classification: +3 bonus
* 500 patent families/year: +2 bonus
* 100 patent families/year: +1 bonus

Competitive Intensity Metrics:
   * 50 different assignees filing patents: +2 bonus
   * Top 5 assignees control <50% of patents: +2 bonus (indicates broad competition)
   * New entrants (companies filing first patents in space): +1 per 10 new entrants (max +3)
   * Geographic diversity (>2 countries): +1 bonus
3. Recency Scoring (Weight: 25%)
Recency = (Timeline Score × 0.5) + (Acceleration × 0.3) + (Evolution Signals × 0.2)
Filing Timeline Analysis:
   * Cutting edge (10 points): >70% of patents filed in last 18 months
   * Current wave (8 points): >60% filed in last 24 months
   * Recent surge (6 points): >50% filed in last 36 months
   * Steady stream (4 points): Consistent filings over 3-5 years
   * Mature field (2 points): Patent activity >5 years old
Innovation Acceleration Indicators:
   * Priority claims showing shortened development cycles: +2 bonus
   * Continuation-in-part (CIP) applications showing rapid iteration: +2 bonus
   * Fast-track examination requests: +1 bonus
   * Multiple divisional applications (indicating broad innovation): +1 bonus
Technology Evolution Signals:
   * New CPC/IPC classifications created for technology: +3 bonus
   * Patent offices issuing examination guidelines for field: +2 bonus
   * Increase in PCT filings (international protection sought): +2 bonus
   * Provisional-to-nonprovisional conversion rate >80%: +1 bonus
4. Relevance Scoring (Weight: 20%)
Relevance = (Commercial Applicability × 0.5) + (Strategic Value × 0.25) + (Market Validation × 0.25)
Commercial Applicability:
   * Market-ready (10 points): Products already using patented technology
   * Near-market (8 points): Prototype/pilot stage, licensing discussions active
   * Development stage (6 points): Clear path to commercialization within 2-3 years
   * Research phase (4 points): Practical applications identified but 3-5 years out
   * Exploratory (2 points): Theoretical or very early-stage research
Strategic Value Indicators:
   * Blocking patents (defensive value): +2 bonus
   * Platform patents (enable multiple products): +3 bonus
   * Patent pools formed around technology: +2 bonus
