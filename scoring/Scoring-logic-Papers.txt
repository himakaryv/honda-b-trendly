Frequency = (Growth Rate Score × 0.5) + (Volume Score × 0.3) + (Diversity Score × 0.2)
Recency = (Timeline Score × 0.6) + (Momentum Score × 0.4)
Relevance = (Applicability × 0.5) + (Problem Fit × 0.3) + (Market Alignment × 0.2)

Step 5: Dynamic Calibration
Benchmark Setting:
* Run scoring on 3-5 known successful trends from the past
* Adjust weights if scores don't align with historical importance
* Document threshold scores: >8.0 (Critical), 6-8 (Important), 4-6 (Monitor), <4 (Ignore)
Document threshold scores: >8.0 (Critical), 6-8 (Important), 4-6 (Monitor), <4 (Ignore)
